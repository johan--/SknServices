# Investigations

The collection of files in 'lib/repo' represent my scratchpad of initial ideals around the application of the Repository Pattern.  
So far I've collected a few examples of other implementation, which I'm likely to drop.  

What I'm after is a consolidated interface to the external world outside of the core domain model.  The repository pattern may be able to let me use
domain specific names for datasets I know are hosted by RestFul, WebService, or JMS like APIs; and not just ActiveRecord data objects.  This
is what I'm thinking about at this point.

James,
