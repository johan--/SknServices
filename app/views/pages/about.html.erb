            The Authorized Services project exists to explore Authentication and Authorization services.
            With additional focus on content-based authorization using expanded UserProfile Permission properties.
        </p>
        <h4>Users must first logon before accessing a secured resource.</h4>
        <p>
            Authentication is evaluated with every page request, except for images,
            javascript, and css script files.  Token-based single signon is supported, along with a local Signin page.
            Local Signin includes the popular <em>remember me</em>, and <em>reset my password</em> features
            via secure email.
        </p>

        <h4>All secured page elements shall be assigned an unique id, called URI, by a developer.</h4>
        <p>
            Authorizations are evaluated for each <em>page access</em>, <em>clickable control</em>, and
            for each <em>showable data element</em>.  Page Access authorization is automated by examining the
            the controller name and method to compose the URI for the page.  Clickable (menu items, buttons, etc)
            authorization requires the developer to use programming helpers to implement authorization.  Showable Data Elements
            have two levels of authorization available; Clickable, and content-based
            authorization using the expanded UserProfile permissions, both use the Secure::AccessRegistry.

                    A user might have general access to the Account page which could list five
                    sensitive documents types, but is only allowed to view two document types for that specific
                    account.  Content-based authorization requires a document-type permissions list by account, to
                    enforce access restrictions.

        <h4>Authorization shall consider business entities when determining access restrictions.</h4>
        <p>
            Content-based Authorization goes deeper that the normal show/hide or access/no-access authorization outcomes.
            It first identifies access authorization to a specific business entity. Then specific access, by type, to secure objects related to that entity.

            Secure::AccessRegistry is the controlling class which maps all the pre-defined (URIs) of the
            application to access role strings; which could be externally administered via LDAP or SQL.  The
            Secure::AccessRegistry uses the UserProfile permissions tuples to enable Content-based authorizations; which
            also could be administered via LDAP or SQL.
