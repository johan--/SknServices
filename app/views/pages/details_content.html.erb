            ContentProfile and AccessProfile are implementations of the same core idea, with side benefits.  For lack
            of a better term: ContentProfile is the label adopted to represent that core idea.</p>

        <div class="well">
            <h3>Core Idea</h3>

            <p>In general anything that can be accessed is considered a <strong>content type</strong>.  The specific entity that content is related to is considered a
               <strong>topic type</strong>.  Both types <em>must be fully qualified with their respective <strong>Identifiers</strong></em>.
               Once qualified the two are combined into a holding object called a ContentProfileEntry, and given a descriptive title.</p>
            <p>Most business will have a few topic types and not everyone will be allowed to view the content associated with all instances of that topic type.  Example: A
               Sales Representative should only be able to view commission documents for Accounts in their territory.</p>
            <p>One ContentProfileEntry describes one permission, through the combination of a fully qualified content type and topic type.  It is expected that a
               user's collection would have many of these specialized entries.  Entries
               are themselves assigned to a wrapper object called a ContentProfile which maintains the whole collection.</p>
            <p>ContentProfiles are also the anchor back to the User Profile, using the person authentication key(PAK) or UUID they rely on as <strong>the users</strong> primary identifier.</p>

            <h3>Features</h3>

            <h4>A ContentProfile Implementation offers:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>ContentProfile</strong> is anchored to a specific Authenticated User, by associating and identifying the person using a permanent and persistent identifier from a trusted authentication
                  source; and manages the collection of <strong>ContentProfileEntries</strong> for that user.</li>
              <li>A <strong>ContentEntry</strong> ensures both the Topic and the Content are uniquely identified and specific to their respective types.</li>
              <li>Each <strong>TopicType</strong> identifies one type of business entity class; like an Account, Customer, Order, Product, Branch Office, Partner, etc.  Further, the <strong>TopicTypeValue</strong> contains
                the ID number/reference for that single entity.  An example being: <em>TopicType:Account, TopicTypeValue:12016</em>.</li>
              <li>Each <strong>ContentType</strong> identifies one type of business asset related to the current TopicType; like a Commission Statement for an Account, Order History Document for a
                  Customer, Profitability Report for an Order, etc.  Further, the <strong>ContentTypeValue</strong> contains the ID number/reference, or SearchTerm for that specific type asset (i.e. type, not instance id).  An example being: <em>TopicType:Account,
                  TopicTypeValue:12016, ContentType:Commission, ContentTypeValue:{docTypeID=486}</em>.</li>
              <li>Type Values may contain one or more elements as needed to specifically identify their entity; the ContentProfile class only insists on at least one value.  Values may also be simple values and not refer to
                  external sub-systems.  Here is an example of an operational value that describes the states a branch is licensed to do business
                  in: <em>TopicType:BranchOffice, TopicTypeValue:44201, ContentType:LicensedStates, ContentTypeValue:['Indiana','Michigan','Ohio']</em>.</li>
              <li>Rake Tasks to load and update selection values for Topics, Contents, and their values.  From a User Interface free-hand typing of values is not allowed, only preloaded values are allowed.</li>
              <li>Each ContentType may require a ContentAdapter class to execute the retrieval process.  The actual business asset a ContentType refers to may in fact be stored in a
                  FileSystem, or Document Management System requiring a WebService call to retrieve it; so a content type value is actually a foreign key to access remote instances of that document type.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>

            <p>An implementation would include the content profile model, admin ui to manage profiles and entries, and a content adapter classes focused on retrieval of requested assets.</p>

            <p>This demonstration app contains the database content profile model, xml content profile model, sample data and xml with eight test users, admin ui, filesystem based content adapter classes, and a demo page.</p>
